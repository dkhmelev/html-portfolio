<h1>The best movies according to Khmelev</h1>
<h2>My top-3 movies of all the time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Forest Gump</h3>
<p>
    A story of a retarded man with a big heart who doesn't care about his condition and overcomes obstacles through pain to the love.
</p>

<h3>Untouchables</h3>
<p>
    Poor man starting to take care of a disabled millionaire. A beautiful picture of a true friendship born under difficulties that life brought to two extremely different fates.
</p>

<h3>Top Gear/Grand Tour</h3>

<p>Not a full-length movie, but still cinematic as the best one. Three friends with extremely different understanding of what a car should be struggling in funny and challanging environments in a hope to understand whose car selection is the best.</p>
